        "prompt": "Create a fully functional, user-centric perfume sharing website for the UK and US markets, branded \"Dream Perfume,\" with an Instagram-inspired aesthetic—minimalist, clean, and highly interactive. The website must feel like a live, usable platform with authentic user-generated content (UGC) and core features that cater to perfume enthusiasts. Below is the detailed requirement:\nBrand & Target Audience Brand: Dream Perfume (tone: modern, approachable, luxurious yet relatable) Target Markets: UK & US (language: English; cultural alignment with Western perfume trends, UGC habits, and design preferences)\nCore Functional Modules (Must Be Fully Operational) A. Latest Market Perfumes Display a curated feed of newly launched perfumes (2024-2025 releases) from top brands (e.g., Chanel, Dior, Jo Malone, Byredo, Glossier) and emerging indie labels. Each entry includes: Authentic UGC-style images (natural lighting, non-studio shots—e.g., user holding the bottle, perfume on a vanity, bottle paired with outfits/moody backdrops). Key details: perfume name, brand, launch date, fragrance family (e.g., floral, woody, citrus), top/middle/base notes, and a 1-sentence \"vibe summary\" (e.g., \"Perfect for summer brunch—bright citrus with a hint of vanilla\"). \"Save to Wishlist\" and \"Share\" (Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest) buttons. B. Perfume Rankings Categorized leaderboards (visible via a dedicated tab): Top 10 Best-Selling Perfumes (UK/US combined) Most Popular by Fragrance Type (Floral, Woody, Oriental, Fresh) User-Voted \"Best of 2024\" Each ranking entry includes: rank number, perfume bottle UGC image, brand, total votes/sales data (fictional but realistic, e.g., \"50k+ user votes\"), and a \"See Details\" link to the perfume’s dedicated page. C. User Post Feed (UGC-Centric) A scrollable, Instagram-like feed of user-shared content: Authentic UGC images/videos (no professional studio shots—focus on real users’ experiences: e.g., unboxing, perfume layering, bottle collections, scent pairing with occasions). Each post includes: user username (e.g., @perfume_lover_uk), caption (e.g., \"Obsessed with Dream Perfume’s new vanilla musk—wears so well for date nights! 🫶\"), hashtags (e.g., #DreamPerfume #VanillaMusk #PerfumeGram), and interactive buttons (Like, Comment, Save). Allow users to filter posts by \"Trending,\" \"Recent,\" or fragrance type (via top filter tabs). A prominent \"Post Your Perfume\" button (sticky at bottom) for users to upload their own content (mock upload interface included for realism).\nDesign Style (Instagram-Inspired Minimalism) Color Palette: Soft neutrals (off-white, light gray) as base, with subtle accent colors (muted rose gold, soft lavender) for buttons/accents—no harsh tones. Typography: Modern sans-serif fonts (e.g., Inter, Montserrat) for readability; clean hierarchy (bold headers for sections, light text for captions). Layout: Ample white space, rounded corners for cards/images/buttons, grid-based feed for posts, and a streamlined navigation bar. Interactive Elements: Hover effects (subtle shadow on cards/buttons), smooth scroll animations, and a \"load more\" button for feeds (no infinite scroll overload). Responsiveness: Fully mobile-friendly (works on smartphones/tablets) with adaptive layouts (feed adjusts to screen size).\nVisual Requirements All images must be authentic UGC-style: high-resolution but not over-edited, natural lighting, diverse user scenarios (different skin tones, vanity setups, occasions). Avoid stock photos—prioritize images that look like they were taken with a smartphone (e.g., slight grain, candid angles, personal touches like jewelry/flowers in the background). Consistent image ratio (1:1 or 4:5) for feed posts to maintain a cohesive Instagram-like look.\nAdditional Usability Features Navigation Bar: Logo (Dream Perfume) + Tabs (Latest Perfumes, Rankings, Feed) + Search Bar (search by perfume name, brand, or note). Footer: Simple links (About Us, Contact, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) + Social Media Icons (Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest—aligned with UGC focus). Wishlist: User-specific section (mock login prompt if needed) to save favorite perfumes. The website should feel lively, trustworthy, and easy to navigate—like a go-to community for UK/US perfume lovers to discover new scents, share their finds, and follow trends. Prioritize visual appeal and interactivity to match Instagram’s engaging vibe while keeping the design clean and not cluttered.",
